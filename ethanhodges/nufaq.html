                <h3> Explanation</h3>
                <p>Many authors use their website to post updates on their current work, as well as free short stories and other news. Fanbases grow stronger when they have a concrete location to get news and updates, it mitigates rumors. Authors are asked large quantities of questions, how they write, what books they like, questions about the plot of their books. It can become tedious to answer these questions again and again. A FAQ (frequently asked questions) page allows an author to write out a comprehensive answer to their most common questions. Whenever those questions are asked, authors can just refer people to the website for a full answer. Authors can use their websites to write and publish reviews and opinions on things, current topics and issues in the literary community. Like the FAQ section, these essays can be referenced when the authors are asked for their opinions on complex issues. </p>

Star Trek is a beautiful vision of a hopeful future, where Earth had pushed through all it's issues and is a utopia. It delves deep into complex ethical dilemas as well as talking about modern social issues through aliens as a portrayal of the modern man. Everyone should watch Star Trek.

                <h3>Steven King</h3>
                <p>The following is an excerpt from an essay about Steven King. Steven King is a prolific writer with a historic career. His writing style and technique is unique. Among some literary circles, terms have been created for the different writing styles. There are two major groups: the first called outliners, planners, and plotters, the second known as discovery writers or panzers. Outliners plan their stories from the beginning, allowing for a well put together story with a firm foundation. Discovery writers choose not to plan the storyâ€™s direction before beginning the story, allowing for a freer style and a greater sense of mystery.
